## Usage

### File Upload & Curation Workflow

1. **Staging Phase**: 
   - Drag and drop or browse for files
   - Upload a Markdown file (required) - either upload an existing file or start with a blank document
   - Optionally upload a source document (PDF or DOCX) for reference
   - Only one source document and one Markdown file can be staged at a time; extra files are rejected and listed with reasons
   - Click "Load Documents" to proceed

2. **Active Curation Phase**:
   - Work in a **flexible panel layout** (all panels scroll independently):
     - **üìÑ Source Panel**: View the original document (PDF/DOCX) with continuous scroll (only visible when source document is loaded)
     - **‚úèÔ∏è Editor Panel**: Edit markdown content with a rich, high-performance editor
     - **üëÅÔ∏è Preview Panel**: See a live preview of your markdown as you edit
   - **Panel Management**:
     - **Toggle Controls**: Use toolbar buttons to show/hide any panel (üìÑ Source, ‚úèÔ∏è Editor, üëÅÔ∏è Preview)
     - **Performance Boost**: Hide preview panel for faster editing response during intensive writing
     - **Focus Mode**: Show only the editor panel to eliminate distractions
     - **Source Panel Auto-Hide**: Source panel is automatically hidden when no source document is loaded
     - **Flexible Layouts**: Single panel (100%), dual panels (50%/50%), or triple panels (33%/34%/33%)
   - Use the toolbar for formatting options (bold, italic, headings, lists, links, tables, etc.)
   - Export your curated content using the "Export .md" button at any time

### Supported File Types

- **Source Documents**: PDF (.pdf), Word Documents (.docx) - **Optional**
- **Markdown Files**: Markdown (.md) - **Required**
- **File Size Limits**: 50MB for source documents, 10MB for markdown files

### File Rejection & Error Handling

- A Markdown file is required to proceed. Source documents are optional but only one of each type can be staged at a time. Extra files are rejected and listed with reasons.
- Unsupported file types or files exceeding size limits are rejected with clear error messages.
- Rejected files are shown in a list and can be cleared.
- Loading and error states are clearly indicated during document processing and rendering.

### Markdown Editor Features

- **High-Performance Editor** powered by `@uiw/react-md-editor` with optimizations:
  - Custom toolbar: Bold, italic, strikethrough, horizontal rule, blockquote
  - Unordered/ordered/checked lists, links, images, tables
  - **Performance optimized**: Debounced preview updates (300ms) for smooth typing
  - **React memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and processing
- Clean, focused editing experience with full height and responsive layout
- **Panel Control Benefits**:
  - Hide preview panel for maximum editing performance during intensive writing
  - Focus mode: Show only editor panel to eliminate distractions
  - Flexible workflow: Toggle between editing and preview as needed
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + B**: Bold
